Forked from [`lednerb/nova-action-button-selectors`](https://codeberg.org/Lednerb/nova-action-button-selectors)

This package allows you to add buttons for Nova actions on the detail page instead having them all within the dropdown menu.

This package is based on the original code from [`pitchayakit/nova-action-button-selector`](https://github.com/pitchayakit/nova-action-button-selector) but differs in usage:

Instead of automatically showing all actions as buttons, it allows you to add the `ShowAsButton` trait to the actions you want to display as buttons.
Also it fixes some styling issues.


## Requirements
- `php: ^8`
- `laravel/nova: ^4`

## How to install
```
composer require lemonlabs/nova-action-button-selectors
```
Detail page
![example_1](./docs/main_1.jpg)

Index page with inline action
![example_2](./docs/main_2.jpg)


## Usage

In your Action class define the following trait:

```php
...
use LemonLabs\ActionButtonSelector\ShowAsButton;

class MyAction extends Action
{
    use InteractsWithQueue, Queueable;
    use ShowAsButton;

    ...
```

If you want to hide the button on some Detail pages, use the following method in the Nova Model's `actions` array:

```php
...
 public function actions(NovaRequest $request)
    {
        return [
            MyCustomAction::make()
                ->onlyOnDetail()
                ->withoutConfirmation()
                ->showAsButton(false),

            ...
```
